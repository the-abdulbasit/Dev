                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Live Activities display your app's current data on the Lock Screen, in the Dynamic Island, in CarPlay,
                    and on a paired Mac or Apple Watch, giving people access to information at a glance and allowing them
                    to perform quick actions that are related to the displayed information.</p>
                <p>To offer Live Activities, add code to your existing widget extension or create a new widget extension
                    if your app doesn't already include one. Live Activities use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/WidgetKit", target="_blank">WidgetKit</a> functionality and 
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI", target="_blank">SwiftUI</a> for
                    their user interface. ActivityKit's role is to handle the life cycle of each Live Activity: You use its
                    API to request, schedule, update, and end a Live Activity and to receive ActivityKit push notifications.</p>

                <h2>Review Live Activity presentations on iPhone and iPad</h2>
                <p>Live Activities come in different presentations that appear in various highly visible places.
                    To add support for Live Activities to your iOS or iPadOS app, you must support all presentations.
                    The system automatically chooses the best presentation for each location across a person's devices.</p>
                <p>The Lock Screen presentation appears on the Lock Screen of iPhone and iPad. On an unlocked device that
                    doesn't support the Dynamic Island, the Lock Screen presentation appears as a banner for Live Activity
                    updates that include an alert configuration. For example, if a person uses Mail on a device that doesn't
                    support the Dynamic Island while your app's Live Activity receives an update with an alert configuration,
                    the system displays the Lock Screen presentation as a banner at the top of the screen to let them know about
                    the updated Live Activity.</p>
                <img src="https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/8ffa10d5fcdf94e7a06d03b14b7ec920/live-activity-notch~dark%402x.png", alt="Two iPhones showing dynamic island feature">
                <p>Devices that support the Dynamic Island display Live Activities in the Dynamic Island using several presentations.
                    When there's only one ongoing Live Activity, the system uses the compact presentation. It's composed of
                    two elements: one that displays on the leading side of the TrueDepth camera, and one that displays on
                    the trailing side. Although the leading and trailing elements are separate views, they form a cohesive
                    view in the Dynamic Island, representing a single piece of information from your app. People can tap a compact
                    Live Activity to open the app and get more details about the event or task.</p>
